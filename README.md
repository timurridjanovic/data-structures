# DATA STRUCTURES: 

**Description**: Implementation of a few data structures in python.

## Hash Table:

1. You can create a new hash table object by inputing the number of buckets as a parameter:

```Python
hashTable = HashTable(30)
```

2. You can set a key and a value with the set method:

```Python
hashTable.set("key", "value")
```

3. You can retrieve the value with the get method:

```Python
hashTable.get("key")
```

4. You can look at your table like this:
```Python
hashTable.table
```
